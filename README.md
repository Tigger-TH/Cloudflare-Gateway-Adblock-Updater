# Cloudflare Gateway Adblock Updater

This repository automates updating the Cloudflare Gateway (Zero Trust) with the [Hagezi](https://github.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists) Multi Pro++, Dynamic DNS as well as Native trackers including Samsung, Vivo, OPPO/Realme, Xiaomi and TikTok filter list using GitHub Actions. It fetches the list daily at a given time, processes it (removing duplicates, splitting into 1,000-domain chunks), deletes old lists/policies and finally, creates new DNS blocking policies to enforce the updated filter lists.

Cloudflare's free plan supports up to 300 lists with no more than 1,000 domains in each list (300x1000 = 300K rules max), which is why the list must be split.
